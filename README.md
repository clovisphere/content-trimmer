# content-trimmer

We all use [torrent clients] (www.utorrent.com/) (at least I do), although there are life-savers, I found myself frustrated (sometimes if not all the time) by the typos, or weird naming (convention) of downloaded items i.e instead of *01 Dummy torrent.mp4*, you get the file as *01_dummy_content.mp4* or *01dummycontent.mp4*. 

**content-trimmer** is my ~~stupid~~ way to automate the file *renaming* process -- 'cause doing it manually **SUCKS BIG TIME**! 

######Usage

`python rename.py /path/to/the/folder/that/you/want/content/to/be/renamed`

**content-trimmer** only supports **Python 3**. (sorry!)

######Note

It's very basic at this point -- it removes the extra white space, underscores, dot,.. and replace them with a single space. But I intend to add more features in the future.


Voila:-)
